Bssic Tutorial on Searching Zillow
https://github.com/seme0021/python-zillow

Here is some basic python code to query the zillow api using the python-zillow library.

Note: I suggest keeping your key stored in a ./bin/config/zillow_key.conf file

Initialize the API
import zillow

with open("./bin/config/zillow_key.conf", 'r') as f:
    key = f.readline().replace("\n", "")

api = zillow.ValuationApi()
Find a place given an address
address = "3400 Pacific Ave., Marina Del Rey, CA"
postal_code = "90292"

data = api.GetSearchResults(key, address, postal_code)
Find place using a zillow place id
zpid="2100641621"
detail_data = api.GetZEstimate(key, zpid)
Find comparables
zpid="2100641621"
detail_data = api.GetComps(key, zpid)
Get Deep Search Results
address = "3400 Pacific Ave., Marina Del Rey, CA"
postal_code = "90292"

data = api.GetDeepSearchResults(key, address, postal_code)
Get Deep Comps
zws_id = "<your key>"
zpid = 2100641621
count=10

data = data = api.GetDeepComps(zws_id, zpid, count)
